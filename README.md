# Discoverly

**Discoverly** is a swipe-first food discovery and ordering platform that helps users discover restaurants, explore meals, and complete purchases through a seamless mobile and web experience.

The platform combines a modern food discovery experience with Stellar-powered checkout, enabling fast, affordable, and transparent payment flows between customers and restaurants.

Discoverly is built around making food discovery more engaging by replacing traditional search-heavy restaurant browsing with an intuitive recommendation-driven experience.

---

## Overview

Traditional food ordering platforms often require users to search through large restaurant lists, compare menus, and make decisions manually.

Discoverly introduces a more interactive approach where users can discover food through a swipe-based experience while restaurants gain tools to manage their digital presence.

The platform consists of:

* a mobile application for customers,
* a web dashboard for restaurants and operations,
* an API backend powering the ecosystem,
* a Stellar integration layer for payments.

---

## Core Features

## Food Discovery

Discoverly makes finding food simple and engaging through a swipe-first interface.

Users can:

* browse restaurants and meals,
* swipe through food recommendations,
* discover new restaurants,
* save preferences,
* interact with personalized suggestions,
* move directly from discovery to checkout.

The goal is to make choosing food feel more like discovery than searching.

---

## Customer Experience (Mobile)

The mobile app is the main customer-facing experience.

Users can:

* create and manage accounts,
* explore restaurants,
* view food listings,
* discover meals through swiping,
* manage preferences,
* place orders,
* complete payments,
* track purchase activity.

The mobile experience is optimized for quick interactions and everyday food discovery.

---

## Restaurant Experience (Web Dashboard)

The web application provides restaurants with the tools they need to manage their presence on Discoverly.

Restaurants can use the dashboard for:

* restaurant onboarding,
* profile management,
* menu creation and updates,
* food item management,
* order management,
* customer activity insights,
* payment tracking,
* business operations.

The web dashboard acts as the operational layer of the platform, allowing restaurants to manage the content and experiences customers interact with.

---

## Stellar-Powered Checkout

Discoverly uses Stellar as the payment infrastructure for transactions between customers and restaurants.

The Stellar integration enables:

* fast payment settlement,
* low transaction costs,
* wallet-based checkout,
* transaction verification,
* transparent payment history.

Stellar allows Discoverly to build a modern payment experience while keeping blockchain complexity behind the scenes.
